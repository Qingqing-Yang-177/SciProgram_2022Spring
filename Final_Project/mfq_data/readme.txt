Moral Foundations DATA

This dataset includes data from a survey of respondents in different countries. The survey was the Moral Foundations Questionnaire. The result of this Questionnaire is a score for each person on five core “moral foundations” that are held to underlie Moral Foundations Theory. This theory posits that moral intuitions derive from innate psychological mechanisms that coevolved with cultural institutions.

These foundations concern dislike for the suffering of others (Care), proportional versus egalitarian fairness (Fairness), ingroup loyalty (Loyalty), deference to authority and tradition (Authority), and concerns with physical/spiritual purity and contamination (Purity). Care and Fairness are entailed in individuals’ well-being and have been referred to as the ‘individualizing’ foundations. On the other hand, Loyalty, Authority, and Purity encompass concerns about community, social order, and the maintenance of group bonds and, therefore, have been referred to as the ‘binding’ foundations.

The dataset has data from individual people and gives a score on each of the five foundations as well as gender and country of each person. 

There are four datafiles, each containing data for one country:

MFQ_Hungary.csv
MFQ_Korea.csv
MFQ_Netherlands.csv
MFQ_UK.csv

The files have the following columns:

CARE_AVG: a person's score on the CARE dimension (numeric)
FAIRNESS_AVG: a person's score on the FAIRNESS dimension (numeric)
LOYALTY_AVG: a person's score on the LOYALTY dimension (numeric)
AUTHORITY_AVG: a person's score on the AUTHORITY dimension (numeric)
PURITY_AVG: a person's score on the PURITY dimension (numeric)
Sex: self-reported sex (0: female, 1: male, 2: non-binary) (categorical)
