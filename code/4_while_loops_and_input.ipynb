    "We have already learned about **flow control** using for loops and if/elif/else statements. Another useful construct is the \"while loop\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While loops are really useful because they let your program run until some condition is met: for example you might have some code search for something and only want to end when that is found, or maybe you want a way for a program to run until a user decides to quit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A while loop runs until a condition is met, and if it isn't met they will run forever! \n",
