    "The pandas groupby() method enables rapid sub-setting and combining of a dataframe so that analyses can be done on groups formed by factors in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key things we learned in this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- how the groupby() syntax works for a single or multiple grouping factors\n",
    "- how to use get_group() to pull data for sub-groups of a larger dataset\n",
    "- calculating descriptive statistics within each group created by groupby()\n",
    "\n",
    "There is much more that the groupby() method can do, but this gives us the critical pieces we need for many of the kinds of summaries, figures, and statistics that are common in behavioral and neural sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will continue to work with Pandas throughout the rest of the semester but will not cover everything. \n",
    "\n",
    "For those people interested in pushing into more advanced usage I very highly recommend working your way through Jake VanderPlas's Python Data Science Handbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "He has made notebooks for each chapter available on github:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend starting on Chapter 2 (Introduction to Numpy) in order to ensure you have the foundations for the later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The material will go beyond what we have done so far in this class, but if you are feeling comfortable to this point you will probably be able to get a feel for the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the semester you will all be in a good position to continue your Python learning through this book and if there is a single thing you do to continue improving in Python after this semester, working your way through this book would be a good choice.\n"
